For the list of journals, it seems that there is already a database [[http://www.nepjol.info/index.php/index][here]].
So, I am not collecting the database right now, but I need to properly read what exactly Nepal Journals Online do.
I am a strong believer in open science and believe that all research works must be made openly available.

Also, I would be interested in finding out some scientific way of ranking the journals.
The objective is to provide incentives to the journals to maintain quality.
