# Curated list of Nepalese scholars in Nepal and around the world.
# Also contains foreign scholars closely working on Nepal related topics
# Sort each subheading with google scholar h-index

- A curated list of Nepali scholars and scientists around the world in the field of science and technology.
- Scholars in each sub-fields sorted with google scholar h-index.

- Beneficial to researchers looking to find fellow researchers, network, collaborate or exchange ideas on the problems of common interest.

- Very useful to scientists working in Nepal, or to people like me planning to move back to Nepal, establish a research institute and work over there.

I prefer to keep the repository updated so that it contains currently active researchers who work on research problems and publish articles in reputed conferences and journals of their respected fields.

*Having a PhD is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition* for making into the list.
The person must be active, contributing to the research community, and society by regularly publishing papers.
Thus, someone who is working in an industry but regularly publishes scientific articles related to their work will also be enlisted.

*Note:* I would like to include PhD candidates too, if they are publishing articles in the most reputed international journals/conferences of their respective fields.
But this needs help from people who actually know their field and can make a fair judgment on what qualifies as good quality publications in their respective fields.
