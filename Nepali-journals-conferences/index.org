For the list of journals, it seems that there is already a database [[http://www.nepjol.info/index.php/index][here]].
So, we are not collecting the database right now, but we need to properly read what exactly Nepal Journals Online do.
We strongly believe in open science and that all research works must be made openly available.

Also, we are interested in finding out some scientific way of ranking the journals.
The objective is to provide incentives to the journals to maintain quality.
